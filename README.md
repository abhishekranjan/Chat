# CHAT
This is a chat application that can be used for local usage in a small network. It creates a local server and people connected to the network can do a group or private chat. The chat also gives facilites to block someone from pinging unnecessarily.

# Why I started this
I had seen a lot of times during local camps that people find it difficult to interact with each other may be due to hesitation. Most of the local chats that we find will be again public and the interactions become public. So I was thinking of creating an application where people can talk in public as well as private.


# Upcoming
I have lot of things to do. 
* Bug fixes.
